⚠️ I'm looking for people to help me do a few things here: 
  1. Add branches to support as many languages as possible
  2. Add a Wiki section with solutions and explanations of requisite concepts
  3. Add a special README with links to good resources
  4. Make this a generally awesome resource for Underdogs

PR's are open, there is also a discussion board, and I will follow up on any feature reqs.

**DISCLAIMER:** I didn't make any of these questions. I have no idea who did, but I am grateful to them. I made this repo from the questions at [this Dropbox link](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Programming-practice-problems-Qp6jAVBXAuDZWiz5x6r9J) for a few reasons:

1. It makes it easier to work through them with the mentees
2. Provides an opportunity to learn `git` if needed
3. Keeps in one place all the good resource links I share routinely
